  [1X3.1-1 InfoPolymaking[0X
  
  [2X> InfoPolymaking__________________________________________________[0Xinfo class
  
  If  set to at least 2, the output of polymake is shown. At level 1, warnings
  are shown. This is the default. And at level 0, the polymake package remains
  silent.
  
  
  [1X3.2 Variables for system interaction[0X
  
  The  variables  for  interaction  with  the system are contained in the file
  [11Xenvironment.gi[0X.  Each  of these variables has a function to set it, see [14X1.2[0X.
  If  [9XPOLYMAKE_COMMAND[0X  or  [9XPOLYMAKE_DATA_DIR[0X are set at startup, they are not
  overwritten.  So  if  you  don't  want  (or don't have the rights) to modify
  [11Xenvironment.gi[0X, you can set the variables in your [11X.gaprc[0X file.
  
  [1X3.2-1 POLYMAKE_COMMAND[0X
  
  [2X> POLYMAKE_COMMAND___________________________________________[0Xglobal variable
  
  This variable should contain the name of the polymake program in the form as
  returned      by      [10XFilename[0X      So      a      probable     value     is
  [10XFilename(Directory("/usr/local/bin"),"polymake")[0X.
  
  [1X3.2-2 POLYMAKE_DATA_DIR[0X
  
  [2X> POLYMAKE_DATA_DIR__________________________________________[0Xglobal variable
  
  In  this  directory the files for polymake will be created. By default, this
  generates a temporary directory using [9XDirectoryTemporary[0X
